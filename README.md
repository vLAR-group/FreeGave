This repository will contain the official implementation of the paper: *FreeGave: 3D Physics Learning from Dynamic Videos by Gaussian Velocity*.
FreeGave is a framework that learns 3D geometry, appearance and velocity purely from multi-view videos, achieving SOTA performance in future extrapolation task on four datasets. 

Please feel free to contact me via jinxi.li@connect.polyu.hk or open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
